=======================
Fix Variant Performance
=======================

Use at your own risk.  This encapsulates variant creation in a
function that defers recalculation of everything until after
creation.  It is a sledgehammer, so if you run any customizations
during this process that requires computed values it probably, maybe
might break things.
