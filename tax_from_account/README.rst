================
Tax from Account
================

It is annoying to set taxes on products in a standard sales tax environment
where nearly every product has identical tax treatment.  Its also a source of
errors, especially in multicompany.  Here we simply use the tax assigned to the
account if not taxes are present on the product.

Installation
============

There are no special installation instructions for this module.

Configuration
=============

None.

Usage
=====

Assign taxes to your chart of accounts as appropriate.  If a product
required a different configuration, then assign to a product, but otherwise
nothing to do.

Known issues / Roadmap
