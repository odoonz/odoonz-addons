=======================
Account Central Billing
=======================

Sometimes it is necessary to invoice a partner who is a different entity to the one ordering, such as when dealing
with large buying groups.  This module automatically changes the invoice from the purchasing entity to the invoice
entity.

Supports recursive billing.  So if all invoices to Branch A are billed to Partner A, from Company B, then
Company C invoices for Branch and Partner A will go to Company B, whereas Company B invoices to Branch A will go
to Partner A.

Installation
============

There are no special installation instructions for this module.

Configuration
=============

#. For each centrally billed partner, select the appropriate supplier or customer billing option.
#. Specify the partner to bill / receive bills from

Usage
=====

Once a partner is configured, there are no usage instructions for regular users, invoices are automatically billed.
You can search for invoices either using the billing or purchasing entity.
