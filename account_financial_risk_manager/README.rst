Account Financial Risk Manager
==============================

This module extends the functionality of OCA Financial Risk modules by adding
a separate security group for credit controllers rather than requiring
accounting access to release orders. It also gives credit managers a wizard in order
to bulk set the credit limit for multiple customers.
