=============================
Account Supplier Tax Rounding
=============================

Ordinarily in an ex tax environment rounding is performed
on the ex tax total.  However some suppliers may round early
at the line level.  This module allows you to configure this
easing the entry of vendor invoices and 1c rounding errors.

Installation
============

There are no special installation instructions for this module.

Configuration
=============

#. For each supplier, select the appropriate Purchase Tax rounding option.
#. Suppliers default to the company method, so only those that differ need consideration.

Usage
=====

Once a partner is configured, there are no usage instructions for regular users,
invoices are automatically calculated using the tax configuration.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Not tested if company policy is set to round per line (but changes to compute_all suggest it might work, let us know)

Bug Tracker
===========

Bugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues
