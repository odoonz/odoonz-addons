=======================
Stock Warehouse Address
=======================

Adds a postal address to warehouses.  The use case is in a multi warehouse
environment where you want the warehouse rather than company's address to
appear on docs.

Also adds an optional address to picking types. The use case for this
was purchase orders that sometimes go to a different gate but have same
default location.
