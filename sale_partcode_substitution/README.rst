=========================
Sale Partcode Replacement
=========================

Allows a sales order to be updated by replacing part of a part code of all products in a sale order with another.

For example, if all blue products had BL in their code, and all red ones had RD, you could update the colour or the order.
In general, this module will work best with systemised partcodes and use of variants but there may be other use cases and it is
not dependent on them.
